Create a React Native app, able to run on the iOS and Android devices, that accepts a fully
dynamic data model, displays a UI based on that data model, and performs the tasks defined by
the data model. Your app should provide a drop-down list to select which data model to use, where each data model is defined by a local JSON file (including a human-readable name). Upon selecting a named model, the main interface should display a set of UI elements to do the following:

• Allow users to input scalar values for fields as defined in the data model

• Display calculated values based on user input as defined by the data model
